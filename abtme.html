        <p class="cnt">
          A 17 year old dev and music lover. IT Technician by FIRJAN 
          SENAI with 3 years of experience in robotics. Love being around computers,
          fixing them, it's because of them that I'm who I am. Into cars and automotive 
          engineering in general, still dreaming of getting my first car and working in it.
          Science fiction is by far my favorite genre for books, anime and manga. As you can 
          guess, I'm a big 
          <a href="https://lain.fandom.com/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain_Wiki">Serial Experiments Lain</a>
          fan. Not only SEL, but I really enjoy animes such as 
          <a href="https://ergoproxy.fandom.com/wiki/Ergo_Proxy_Wiki">Ergo Proxy</a> and 
          <a href="https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>.
          <br /><br />
          It's worth mentioning that I really like weapons of all kinds, ground vehicles, aircraft, infantry weaponry...
          I'm an aficionado for their engineering and working process.
